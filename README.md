as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.linux/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.
  
Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

# Linux.linux
A repository mapping out my Linux file system.

***

## About

See above. This repository goes into depth on the structure of my Linux desktop, and has a web-interface for navigating it. This is a personal project.

***

## Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.linux/wiki)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

***

## Navigation

Here is a navigational sitemap (or systemMap) of my Linux desktop (personal)

[Root](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.linux) - Not a functional link, will reload the page.

> [Bin](https://github.com/Linux.linux) - Not a functional link, will reload the page.

> > [Snap](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.Ubuntu.SnapPackages) - For Ubuntu snap packages.

> [Home](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.Home) - The home directory, the root of most major directories.

> > [Videos](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.home.Videos) - Not used very often, I use the desktop instead.

> > [Pictures](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.Pictures) - A very common directory, used to store screenshots and other pictures.

> > [Desktop](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.Desktop) - My desktop, for display and access.

> > [Documents](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.home.Documents) - Starting to become more commonly used, used to store notes, and miscellaneous documents.

> > [Public](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.Public) - I use the public directory for basic file sharing, and to store my most used files, so I can easily access them.

> > [Music](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.Music) - I don't use this folder at the moment (As of Saturday, June 12th 2021 at 3:00 pm)

> > [Templates](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.Templates) - I don't use this folder at the moment (As of Saturday, June 12th 2021 at 3:00 pm)

> > [Trash](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Linux.Trash) - Just a trash can, nothing special... <!-- Repo ideas: documentation, all Linux trash can icons !-->

Extras:

[My Linux setup, a set of commands used for maintaining my Linux installation](https://github.com/seanpm2001/My-Linux-setup)

***

## UNIX directory structure scheme

Here is the structure scheme of the UNIX file system, that is used on Linux. It is simple but useful.

![UNIX_Structure.png](/UNIX_Structure.png)

An extra pro: compared to Windows, all characters are legal in file names, except for just 1, which is `/`

***

## Sponsor info

![SponsorButton.png](SponsorButton.png)

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
